## 📈 Impact Assessment

**What's Working Well:**
- Core databases are properly structured
- Workflow stages match research requirements
- Content Hub has sample content for testing

**What Needs Attention:**
- **Engagement Tracker is completely missing** - This is a core feature
- Dashboard experience isn't cohesive yet
- No automation documentation
- No onboarding sequence

**Bottom Line:**
The foundation is solid (5/6 core databases), but the **Engagement Tracker** must be added immediately for the system to match the product vision. The other missing features (dashboard, views, automations) are important but can be added iteratively based on user feedback.
