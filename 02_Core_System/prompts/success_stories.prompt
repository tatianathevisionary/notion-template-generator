Start populating each database with real or sample data to test the structure

### 2. **Create Relations Between Databases**
Link related items across databases:
- Link Opportunity Hub entries to Product Specs
- Link Product Specs to Experiments
- Link Experiments to Launch initiatives

### 3. **Customize Properties**
Modify the databases to fit your workflow:
- Add custom properties
- Adjust select options
- Create formulas
- Add rollup properties

### 4. **Create Views**
Set up different views for each database:
- **Opportunity Hub**: Board by Priority, Table by Status
- **Product Spec**: Timeline view by Target Release
- **Experiment Tracker**: Calendar view by Start Date
- **Launch Hub**: Timeline view by Launch Date

### 5. **Build Page Templates**
Create reusable page templates for each database entry with standard sections

### 6. **Set Up Automations**
Consider integrating with:

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Script Configuration
- **API Key**: `ntn_Y36581308888Vfh414I9aHzOwm8QgZFxHFeouPaJMWq8a3`
- **Parent Page**: `2830da0aa5c8807e9b5cf5c9411b445f`
- **Python Version**: 3.13
- **Notion SDK**: 2.2.1

### Files Created
- `notion_api_client.py` - API wrapper (renamed from `notion_client.py` to avoid conflicts)
- `main.py` - Template generator script
- `templates/*.json` - Database schema definitions
- `.env` - Configuration (not tracked by git)

### Issue Resolved
✅ Fixed circular import issue by renaming `notion_client.py` → `notion_api_client.py`

## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Modify Database Schemas
Edit the JSON files in `templates/` to customize properties:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "Custom Field": {
      "type": "text",
      "description": "Your custom field"
    }
  }
}
```

### Re-run the Generator
To create updated versions:
1. Delete old databases in Notion (or keep them for reference)
2. Update the JSON templates
3. Run `python main.py` again

### Add New Databases
1. Create a new JSON template in `templates/`
2. Add a new function in `main.py`
3. Call it in the `main()` function
