## Key Insights & Decisions

Every week brings new learnings that shape our approach. Here's what we discovered:

### Strategic Decisions

- Upgraded to Notion API 2025-09-03 despite breaking changes for future multi-source functionality
- Built modular tools instead of monolithic script for better maintainability

### Technical Learnings

- Data source IDs are mandatory in 2025-09-03 - every page creation must use data_source_id as parent
- Real content beats empty schemas - users need production-ready templates with examples

---

## Challenges & Solutions

Transparency is key. Here are the challenges we're navigating:

**Blocker:** Content volume challenge - creating rich content for all 5 databases will be time-intensive (4-6 hours per database)

---

## What's Next

Looking ahead, our top priority is: **Extend enhancement capabilities to remaining 4 databases with web-searched resources**

### Planned Work

- Build multi-format update generation system (Document, Slack, LinkedIn, Blog)
- Enhance remaining 4 databases with rich content and interactive elements
- Integrate web search to find and embed relevant images and resources
